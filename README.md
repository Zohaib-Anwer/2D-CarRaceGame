# 2D CarRaceGame
This is my first C# project uploaded to GitHub. Developed with WinForms, it's an exhilarating 2D car racing game. Dodge enemy vehicles and collect as many coins as possible. The game tests your reflexes to the limit—one touch from an enemy vehicle, and it’s game over. How many coins can you gather before your luck runs out?
